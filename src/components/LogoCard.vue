            It has been our life dream to help animals who are seen as
            undesired, and unloved. We do what we can to help each stray, by
            spaying or neutering them to stop the population from growing. We
            also do our best to rehome them as they do not have homes of their
            own to go to. We also provide family services for families that can
            not afford to get their beloved pets the care they need. These
            animals live in the streets, barely finding enough food to keep them
            healthy and happy. That is exactly what our mission is. We need YOUR
            help to continue this organization and to give stray cats and dogs
            the better life that they deserve.
          </p>

            Our organization here in Mexico has been a challenge, but we are
            determined to fight for the animals that never had a voice.
            Thousands of litters are put in plastic bags and left to fend for
            themselves or to die. That is just another reason we are fighting so
            hard to help these animals.
